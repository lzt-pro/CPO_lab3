## laboratory work number: 1

## variant description

In this variant, we  implement a lazy library for a single-linked list. For that, we use closures. Usage of generators (yieldstatement) or async (async, await statements) is not allowed.



## synopsis 

work of Zhentao Liu &Shuo Cui :

1. implement the following API:
   - head(List) – return a list first element. If the list is empty – raise an exception. Only at this step head element should be evaluated. Each element should be evaluated only one time.
   - tail(List) – return tail of the list.
   - length(List).
   - map(List, Function) and reduce(List, Function, Initial State).
   - mempty().
   - mconcat(List1, List2) – should not force list evaluation.
   - from_list(pythonList) and to_list(List).
   - it should be an iterator.
2. To proof correctness, we write unit tests, properties-based tests.
